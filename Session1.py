"""
any source file of python i.e. with extension .py
is known as MODULE :)

    we will not have any main function in python program
    BUT
    we can create as well explicitly if we want

    Hence, whatever we code in module gets executed automatically
    in a sequence i.e. line by line (interpretation)
